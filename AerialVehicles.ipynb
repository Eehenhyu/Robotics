    "There are different types of aerial vehicles, I'll focus on unmanned small units(drones). Drones can employ different algorithms to perform tasks without the need for human supervision,control, or intervention, but can also be completely controlled when needed. I'll go through some of these differences below.\n",

    "The design of the vehicle is also important as different designs have different limitations, for example: Fixed Wing drones can operate well in restricted paths but can't hover or turn quickly; Flapping Wing drones can hover but are complicated to program as we don't have easy models for avian/insect flight; Rotor Crafts are what I'll focus on since they can hover and have good manuverability(like a helicopter), and they're easier to model. \n",

    " - By looking at the thrust vs rpm curve it's easy to determine what speed is required to produce 1/4 the weight which is the operating speed of the quadrotor, but this speed also produces a drag moment which every rotor has to overcome, so the motor has to produce enough torque to overcome this drag moment\n",
